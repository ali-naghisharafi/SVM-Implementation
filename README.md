    <h1>Support Vector Machines (SVM) Implementations</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our repository where we delve into the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for educational purposes in our Machine Learning course. This repository is designed to facilitate a deep understanding of SVM through practical examples and custom implementations.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this repository, you will find two main types of SVM implementations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>SVM with scikit-learn</strong>: Utilize the powerful scikit-learn library to implement standard SVM models quickly and efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>SVM from Scratch</strong>: Challenge yourself by building SVM models from the ground up, gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>We cover a range of scenarios and advanced topics in SVM, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kernel SVMs</strong>: Explore the use of different kernels such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to understand how they influence the decision boundaries of the SVM.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiclass Classification</strong>: Learn how to extend the binary classification capability of SVM to handle multiple classes, which is essential for dealing with more complex datasets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with the implementations, clone this repository using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git</code></pre>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Ensure you have the following installed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.x</li>
        <li>scikit-learn</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Matplotlib (for visualizations)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can install the necessary libraries using pip:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib</code></pre>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Each file in the repository is a standalone example of a specific SVM scenario. Hereâ€™s how you can run each:</p>
    <pre><code>python svm_with_sklearn.py
python svm_from_scratch.py</code></pre>
