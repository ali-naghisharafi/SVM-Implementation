# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Implementations

Welcome to our repository where we delve into the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for educational purposes in our Machine Learning course. This repository is designed to facilitate a deep understanding of SVM through practical examples and custom implementations.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find two main types of SVM implementations:

1. **SVM with scikit-learn**: Utilize the powerful scikit-learn library to implement standard SVM models quickly and efficiently.
2. **SVM from Scratch**: Challenge yourself by building SVM models from the ground up, gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.

## Features

We cover a range of scenarios and advanced topics in SVM, including:

- **Kernel SVMs**: Explore the use of different kernels such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to understand how they influence the decision boundaries of the SVM.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Learn how to extend the binary classification capability of SVM to handle multiple classes, which is essential for dealing with more complex datasets.
